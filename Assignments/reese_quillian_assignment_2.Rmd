### Article Summary

This article discusses various opinions about the future of search engines (Google) as the capabilities of AI/language models grows. With the recent release of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which is heavily invested in by Microsoft, there are many speculations regarding whether Microsoft's holdings in the language model will help overtake Google. Consensus is that, though we do not know how things will unfold, search engines and language models will be combined in some way in the near future. While some say that LMs will overtake SEs completely, most recognize that a combination of the two will likely be most powerful. Google has two alternatives to weigh: assume the "reputational risk" of trying to implement this new tech, or wait until it is more developed, at the risk of letting a competitor like Microsoft beat them to it. Below are 3 takeaways from the author's opinion of this tech battle:

  1. Google's threat is not OpenAI, it is Microsoft
  2. Google will have to decide whether they want to take the risk of implementing LM based search
  3. Regardless of who (Google or Microsoft) takes the lead on this, they will need to figure out how to make it profitable
